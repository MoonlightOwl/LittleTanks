# LittleTanks
This is a small game about, eh... tanks.

Written on holidays, at my spare time, in Java + Swing, just for fun.

All that I had in my notebook was only Java 6, text editor and Terminal for compiling. 
Therefore, source codes are a bit.. frightening. But I promise to improve it. =)

## Controls
Key | Action
--- | ---
`Arrows` | Select menu / move tank
`Space` | Fire!
`C` | Place bomb (if any)
`[` | Mute sound
`]` | Mute music
`\` | Next music track 
`P` | Pause game
`Escape` | Return to menu / Exit

## Levels
Game contains a few test levels. They form "level packs" (or "missions"). All files can be found in `/levels/` directory.

You need to click first menu item (in square brackets) to change current "package".

For example: "_level_", "_metal_", "_maze_" or "_test_".

Score table for any level pack, can be found in `/scores/` directory. Just remove corresponding file, to clear the table. 


## Sources building
You can easily build game sources by yourself.

Create a project in your favorite IDE, and download sources from this Git.

Attach JLayer library (http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html).
And LuaJ SE library (for LittleTanks 1.5+) (http://www.luaj.org/luaj/3.0/README.html).

Set root project folder as working directory, and then launch game from `LittleTanks` class.
